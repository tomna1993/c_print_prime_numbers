# c_13_prime_numbers

## DESCRIPTION

Prime numbers are defined as whole numbers greater than 1, whose only factors are 1 and itself. So 3 is prime because its only factors are 1 and 3, while 4 is composite and not prime, because it is the product of 2 Ã— 2. In this lab you will write an algorithm to generate all prime numbers in a range specified by the user.

```bash
$ ./build/prime
prime/ $ ./prime
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 100
2
3
5

11

17

```

The easiest way to check if a number is prime, is to try dividing it by every number from 2 up to, but not including, the number itself. If any number divides into it with no remainder, that number is not prime.

The `main` function in the distribution code contains a `for` loop that iterates through the range specified by the user, with both ends inclusive. For example, if the user types in `1` for `min` and `100` for `max`, the `for` loop will test each number, 1 to 100. Each of these numbers is passed to a function, prime, that you will implement to return either `true` or `false` depending on whether the number is prime.

### Thought Question
Can you make the prime-finding algorithm more efficient than checking if a number is divisible by every number between 2 and 1 less than itself? Can you think of another way to generate prime numbers?

- The answer is yes, we don't have to check if the given number is divisible with every number. We have to check just up until the half of the given number because the number won't be divisible to an even number.

## INSTALL LIBRARIES

The source code uses the cs50 library what you can download [HERE](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).

To install the cs50 library follow the steps:

1. Open git bash terminal and change the current working directory to `src`:  
   > cd ./libsc50/src

2. Compile the cs50.c source into .o with:
   > gcc -c cs50.c -o cs50.o

3. Make the library archive:  
   > ar rcs libcs50.a cs50.o

4. Copy the `libcs50.a` file into your compiler's `lib` directory

5. Copy the `cs50.h` file into your compiler's `include` directory

## COMPILE AND RUN THE CODE

The code is written in C, the compiler used to generate the exe is: `gcc Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project 12.2.0`

Run the below code in terminal (git bash) to compile the source:

> gcc commandLineArgument.c -lcs50 -o ./build/commandLineArgument

To run the executable run the below code in terminal (git bash):

> ./build/commandLineArgument.exe
